## A step-by-step guide using R

Repository for the book project "Individual-based models of cultural evolution. A step-by-step guide using R", by Alberto Acerbi, Alex Mesoudi, and Marco Smolla (authors in alphabetical order). 

The repository contains so far a minimal working structure of the book, realised with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org). 

The first two chapters are copied (unmodified) from the previous temporary [repository](https://github.com/albertoacerbi/IBM-cultevo).

In addition, the folder [material/](material) contains (also from the previous temporary [repository](https://github.com/albertoacerbi/IBM-cultevo)): 

* [General.md](https://github.com/albertoacerbi/IBM-cultevo-bookdown/blob/master/material/General.md): a document with general considerations about the project

* [TOC.md](https://github.com/albertoacerbi/IBM-cultevo-bookdown/blob/master/material/TOC.md): Table of content draft
