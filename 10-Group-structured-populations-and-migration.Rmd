# Group structured populations and migration {#group-structure}

<!-- Explaining fundamentals of networks -->
In the previous chapters, we have assumed that all individuals in our simulations are equally likely to interact with each other. In many situations, this is a justified assumption, for example, when looking at a small population or a limited geographic area. Sometimes, however, populations are subdivided into groups were individuals are more likely to interact with others within and less with those outside their group. 

In this chapter, we will simulate subdivided populations and test how this affects the spread of a new trait across groups and the population. We will also simulate the diffusion of traits in a population based on migration events between groups.
