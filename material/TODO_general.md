# TO DO general

* Possible other models to add:

  * Axelrod's dissemination of culture?

* An interesting aspect trasversal to all models is how traits are considered (binary, many, continuos, etc.) and how copy happens (actually assuming one trait, or many traits, getting more "close", etc.). This is not much disucssed in cutural evolution literature (it is in post-Axelrod stuff).

* Figures other than plots?

* More advanced analyses?

* an R library?
