## A step-by-step guide with R


### Basics

1. Unbiased transmission - Alex (Alberto tidy)
2. Biased/unbiased mutation - Alex (Alberto tidy)
3. Biased transmission (direct/content bias) - Alex (Alberto tidy)
4. Biased transmission (indirect: frequency) - Alex (Alberto tidy)
5. Biased transmission (indirect: demonstrator) - Alberto
6. Vertical/horizontal/oblique transmission - Alex
7. Model of the above with multiple traits (here we will need a bit for performance/matrices, etc.) - Alberto
