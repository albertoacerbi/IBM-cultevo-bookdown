# Individual-based models of cultural evolution
## A step-by-step guide with R


### Basics

1. Unbiased transmission
2. Biased/unbiased mutation
3. Biased transmission (direct/content bias)
4. Biased transmission (indirect: frequency)
5. Biased transmission (indirect: demonstrator)
6. Vertical/horizontal/oblique transmission
7. Model of the above with multiple traits (here we will need a bit for performance/matrices, etc.)


### Advanced topics

#### The evolution of cultural evolution

8. Rogers' model
9. 'Solutions' to Rogers' model

#### Culture and populations

10. Group-structured populations and migration
11. Social network structure
12. Demography and cultural evolution 

#### Cultural inheritance

13. Selection and transformation
14.	Social learning of social learning rules
15.	Trait inter-dependence

(early AM plan)

#### Part 1: Cultural microevolution

Model 1: Unbiased transmission
Does not change trait frequency over time. Introduce concept of drift.
B&R Ch 3

Model 2: Biased/unbiased mutation
Unbiased mutation results in equal proportion of all traits. Biased mutation favours the favoured trait, which spreads via an r-shaped curve. 
B&R Ch 3

Model 3: Biased transmission (direct/content bias)
Selection for one trait over the other, favours the favoured trait, which spreads via an s-shaped curve.

Model 4: Conformity
Favours the most-common trait, which depends on initial conditions

Model 5: Migration
Acts to reduce between-group variation. Add selection and conformity, this counteracts the effect of migration.

Model 6: Blending inheritance of continuous traits
Blending destroys variation. Add mutation, show that this counteracts blending.
B&R Ch 3

Model 7: Vertical vs oblique vs horizontal transmission
H faster than O faster than V. 

Model X: Iterated learning / Bayesian inference?


#### Part 2: The evolution of cultural evolution

Model 8: Evolution of social learning
Rogers’ paradox, SL evolves when E changes, but does not enhance pop fitness

Model 9: Evolution of cumulative culture
CCE as solution to Rogers’ paradox?

others? Evolution of conformity (Henrich & Boyd)?


#### Part 3: Cultural macroevolution

Model X: Population dynamics
Turchin predator-prey model

Model X: Cultural group selection
??? (many possibilities)

Model X: Demography and cumulative culture
Tasmanian model

Model X: Cultural phylogenetics
???

(early AA and MS plan)

#### Unstructured populations
	
* Information diffusion (simple and complex contagion dynamics)
*	Biased transmission (prestige, success, (anti-)conformity to majority)

#### Structured populations

* Age structured populations 
*	Transmission modes (random, vertical, horizontal, oblique)
*	Social network structure (fixed versus dynamic networks)

#### Other topics

*	Feedback between individuals/population and environment
* Cultural niche construction
*	Social media dynamics, voter dynamics, and fashion, trends and fads
*	Social learning of social learning
*	Trait inter-dependence
*	Cultural Attraction Theory
