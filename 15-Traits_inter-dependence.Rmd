# Traits inter-dependence

Relationships between traits are important. Examples.

Imagine a simple scenario when there are only two possible relationships between traits (compatible or incompatible), they are simmetric (if A is compatible with B, also B will be compatible with A):

Traits    |  A |  B |  C |  D 
----------|---:|---:|---:|---:
 **A**    |    | +1 | -1 | -1 
 **B**    | +1 |    | -1 | -1 
 **C**    | -1 | -1 |    | +1 
 **D**    | -1 | -1 | +1 |    



```{r 15.1, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(111)

```
